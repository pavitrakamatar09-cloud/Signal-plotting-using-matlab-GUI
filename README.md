# Signal-plotting-using-matlab-GUI
I have plotted 2 types of signals including sine signal, triangular signal and composite signal by using matlab GUI
This project demonstrates how to plot and visualize four different types of signals using MATLAB GUI. It is designed for students, researchers, and hobbyists to understand basic waveform generation and plotting in MATLAB.

The MATLAB GUI plots the following signal types:
1. *Sine Signal*  
   - Generated using MATLAB’s built-in sin function.
2. *Square Signal*  
   - Generated using MATLAB’s built-in square function.
3. *Triangular Signal*  
   - Generated using MATLAB’s sawtooth function with appropriate parameters to create a triangular waveform.
4. *Composite Signal*  
   - Created by adding two or more signals together.

I have used matlab2016a version to get the results
